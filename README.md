# Near Miss Dashboard

## Overview
Near Miss Dashboard is a web-based application for visualizing near-miss and incident data from construction or industrial environments. The dashboard helps analyze trends, identify high-risk categories, locations, regions, and unsafe behaviors using interactive charts.

The project consists of a Node.js backend that serves near-miss data from a JSON file and a React (Vite) frontend that visualizes the data using Recharts.
